One Battle After Another,7,"Sorry but this doesn't deserve all the 10/10s. Granted it's good, and I like most of PTA's films, but it's not like this is anywhere near as brilliant as something like There Will Be Blood or The Master. The plot is very simple, and while that's not a bad thing, I found it difficult finding anything substantial to grab onto. The performances are certainly good but again it feels like all the actors with the exception of probably Chase Infiniti and maybe Sean Penn aren't given a whole lot to do. In my opinion this was far less interestingly photographed than something like Phantom Thread, and with less compelling characters than something like The Master, and lacked the spectacle and gravitas of something like There Will Be Blood. Still better than most films releasing these days, but if you're looking at all the rave reviews like I was and expecting a masterpiece, from my perspective I'd be lowering my expectations. It gets a 7/10 for being well performed and pretty well written, but I can't go beyond that because it lacked the depth I'd normally be seeking from filmmakers of PTA's caliber."
One Battle After Another,8,"Long movie who doesn't get boring. Finally I know how to remember the name Paul Tomas Anderson! A man in my countryside municipality here in Norway has the same first name and first part of his family name fits with Tomas, so I just think of him! Anyways, I liked One battle after another. It's long and winding, but there are lots of good actors, and since the script is good, we kind of care about them. The bad guys are over the top, almost caricatures, and one of them at least is very tragic and gets a sad demise that he kind of deserves, although I felt close to ashamed about it. I enjoyed my time at the cinema. The pop corn was only 35 norwegian kroner and I brought a marzipan dark chocolate bar. I'm already looking forward to the next movie by Paul Thomas Anderson."
One Battle After Another,6,"One Battle Too Many. I saw 'One Battle After Another' last night, and I'm still not sure I get the hype. On paper, the film has everything: social commentary, action, radical politics, immigration, parenthood, even extremism. It tries to juggle so many weighty ideas at once - and I do applaud that - it's ambitious, topical, clearly trying to stir the pot. But ambition alone doesn't make for satisfying cinema, and this one ends up messy. At nearly three hours long, it's a slog when you still don't really know the people you're meant to care about. Not a single character feels grounded - Benicio del Toro aside (and even then, his screen time is frustratingly short). The rest make decisions that have zero logic in the absence of backstory, leaving them feeling exaggerated and hollow. So many talented actors, yet I wasn't rooting for anyone. The ""big message"" moments - racism, political division, systemic power, identity - land far too on the nose, skimming the surface without ever cutting deep. If I'm being fair, one thing I did love was the soundtrack - tense, pulsing, and full of nervous energy, it injects more urgency than the script ever does. But pace and tone overall are uneven. PTA's usual offbeat humour is basically MIA, and without it, long stretches drag and feel oddly dull. The film indulges its own grandeur, with sprawling chases and spectacle, but without clarity or cohesion. Honestly? It's his weakest film yet. It wants to be grand, relevant, provocative - and in parts it succeeds - but just doesn't hold it together. In the end, there's no clear overall message, just a lot of battles, one after another, that feel thrown at you without being stitched into something coherent."
One Battle After Another,5,"Falls short. It seems people must be overly easily impressed giving this 9 or 10. Dont understand the hype. Its messy and just not that engaging. Its well made but its like a dish that smells and looks fantastic but tastes a bit bland. Difficult to say which ingredients are missing, but one thing that struck me from early on is I didnt really like or care about any of the characters. Many of them are just nasty, unlikeable. It couldnt seem.to make its mind up what it wanted to be, and many long scenes were pointless. The action wasnt anywhere near as insane as people say. The chase was good, but Bullett still has the best car chase of all time! It was a mixed bag. Often silly comedic at odd times, which wasnt very funny either. I felt like it has four or five writers all pulling it in different directions of action, thriller, dark humour, and not that great at any of it. It held me, but only just, and it does pick up after about an hour. I think if Id been on my own (my partner had the same review as me after) I may have walked, which I very rarely do I kept thinking it was like a try hard Rob Zombie/Tarantino/Scorcese movie but fell way short. I gave it 5, but its maybe a 6.5 at best."
One Battle After Another,5,"After 2.5 hrs you are no wiser. What is this movie about? It starts with the ""French 75"", a group with ideolical goals. Their rebellion changes nothing and their members soon end up in jail. This is portrayed without obvious moral underlining. The other half of the Paul Thomas Anderson movie is a family drama. That's also when the video editor decided to continue his work on an old VCR device. We get to see intense emotions, wild car chases and a few comedic performances. At the end there is a hardly character devolpment to be witnessed. One of the main characters pretty much stays the same. It's a shame, that this film lacks a clear continuity storywise. The formula follows the modern storytelling: intense emotions replace a stunning script. Of course, the cinematography is high standard, outstanding and well crafted. Yet the movie was not convincing. No rewatch planned. Try harder next time."
One Battle After Another,9,"Action with a difference. At just shy of 3 hours, 'One Battle After Another' is compelling - and it keeps the viewer interested for the duration. This is a great achievement for such a long movie, as some movies of this length can tend to drag. That's not the case here - I found myself completely absorbed in the story within the first 10 minutes. And I stayed that way until the end. I just had to know what happened. While the plot is somewhat complicated, it's also a fascinating and multi-layered story that's weaved together in a clever manner that draws you in. And, while you need to pay attention, this does not detract from the experience at all. In fact, it makes it even better and all the more entertaining. The story centres on the activities of a group of modern-day revolutionaries known as 'the French 75', who leave all manner of destruction and chaos in their wake. In addition, the story explores the relationship between Bob - played by Leonardo DiCaprio - and fellow revolutionary Perfidia Beverly Hills, played by the talented Teyana Taylor. Taylor delivers a blistering performance as a rebel dedicated to her cause and brings a real intensity to the role. So much so that her energy almost emanates from the screen. Also at the centre of the story is Willa - played by Chase Infiniti. Willa is the daughter Bob shares with Perfidia. Then there's Sean Penn, who delivers a compelling performance as Colonel Steven Lockjaw, a military man dedicated in his relentless pursuit of the French 75. Villainous only begins to describe Penn's Colonel Lockjaw, as viewers also get to see a selfish man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. Another great character is Sensei Sergio St. Carlos, played by Benicio Del Toro, who is absolutely fantastic. He lends an element of humour to the film, which serves to break the tension on many occasions. This includes one particularly funny scene where, having been pulled over by the police, he is forced to do a sobriety test. And of course, Di Caprio is brilliant in his role as a revolutionary, who is still a caring father that wants to protect his daughter from harm. Chase Infiniti also delivers a spectacular performance as Willa, a character who truly evolves over the course of the movie. The story takes place over (roughly) 15 - 20 years, so you get to see Bob evolve over time. You also get to see Willa as a teenager. This is an important aspect of the plot, so I won't say too much more on that. The various characters meet at several different times during the film, and each interaction is more and more unique. The supporting cast, including Colonel Lockjaw's soldiers, as well as protestors, and teenagers at a school dance, all deliver strong performances that provide the story with plenty of variety and intrigue. There are many themes explored in the film. For a start, you have corruption, racism, and rebellion against authority. Additionally, there is an exploration of the role secret societies play in maintaining what they believe to be 'balance' in the world. This last theme is particularly interesting and, while the society in this story has abhorrent values, this adds an extra layer to an already good story. While you don't always learn a lot about every character's background, the actors' performances more than make up for this, as does the intricate story telling. Plus, not knowing too much about the characters adds to the mystery around them. Additionally, it lends a gritty, almost bleak element to the story. Sometimes, not knowing and using your imagination is better than knowing a character too well, although that's just a personal view of mine. The film is well-paced too, with not a lot of down time. There's almost always a sense of 'what will happen next', as even when things seem steady, there's still an undercurrent of tension. There are also moments where you get to see characters' vulnerabilities and flaws. In my view, this adds to the appeal and depth of the movie. There is also a great soundtrack that matches the pace with the events on screen really well. The music is a little different to what you might see in more traditional action movies. But here it works like a charm. Additionally, there is amazing cinematography that captures the essence of the story - a struggle for power and a fight against corruption. Thanks to skilled editing, the multiple layers of the story are weaved together effortlessly. There's also a car chase toward the end of the movie that provides a unique take on this classic action film technique. The scene brings with it a quiet, yet focused intensity. Featuring a modern-day blue Mustang and white Dodge Charger, the colours of these vehicles - along with the roar of their V8 engines - complement the otherwise stark desert background perfectly. Plus, the cinematography during this scene - filmed on a deserted highway - is spectacular. During the sequence, the suspense builds and builds until one of the film's climactic scenes. One Battle After Another is unconventional, but in the best possible way. There are some plot twists that make the movie unpredictable, so you'll never be able to pick the ending. The combination of excellent direction - thanks to Paul Thomas Anderson - skilled editing, an excellent story, great cinematography, compelling performances and a unique soundtrack elevate this film from what could have been just another action movie to a fantastic film. When you see this movie, go to the cinema, it's well worth it."
One Battle After Another,9,"Prevalent and cinematic! 'One Battle After Another' is true to its name in every aspect and serves as a deliberate attempt at topical commentary on the radical nature of war wrapped in a revolutionary tale of freedom. Strong performances all around, including DiCaprio's 'Bob Ferguson' and Penn's 'Steven J. Lockjaw' leading the charge with standout performances that chewed the scenery at every opportunity. The score at times comes in with a dramatic punch yet knows how to dial it back through bouncy percussion and helps in creating tense, lofty, and poignant character moments. Occasionally, the runtime can be felt with the film slowing down and taking its time to breathe, but the majority of the film is paced with precision and never feels like a tedious watch. Thematically resonant, the subject matter throughout is grounded, complex, yet still has a sense of simplicity that can sometimes create a tonal dissonance in parts of its satirical nature. The modernization of filmmaking here is truly something to behold and Director Paul Thomas Anderson surely adds a great dimension to his illustrious career with this level of cinematic storytelling. Taking every sudden turn with undying conviction, 'One Battle After Another' is a fury of social commentary with a fitting cast of intricate characters and sees past its distractions to become a thoroughly engaging and prevalent theatrical experience."
One Battle After Another,9,"Well Crafted, A Return to the Art of Movie Making. I really liked this movie. To me, it was well crafted and didn't rely on gratuitous violence, foul language, and absurdity to tell a story. The attention to detail and cinematography was top shelf. Do they give Oscars for set and prop execution? The beauty is in the details as we follow Leo on this two and half hour journey. The film is authentic and approachable without missing any Hollywood glamor. And while it is long, it is seamless and without technical fault. And at times it is mesmerizing, reflective art. The car ""chase"" is as suspenseful as any over the top chase, if not more so, and shot with artists and a new approach. The movie is simply beautiful in the small and the large ways. The characters are relatable and for such a simple film, they are interesting and dare I say complex to a certain extent. There isn't a character in here that isn't interesting. This a testament to good writing, good acting, and good direction...and good casting. My favorite in some ways was Benicio Del Toro who brings calm and down to earth grounding to an anxiety inducing middle of the movie, along with some low key humor. He's a good friend to all, and that makes a great character, beer in hand. Chase Infiniti does a fantastic job acting, brining a strong performance to the big screen. Leo brings his usual great acting, and his character has humor that is authentic and would be hard not to embrace. And Sean Penn provides a master class in odd ball behavior and method acting. This is easily a 8/9 out of 10 and should have good re-watch ability."
Jurassic World: Rebirth,5,"Another disappointing sequel. I didn't go in with very high expectations, but this still should have been better considering David Koepp was returning as a writer and Gareth Edwards is a good choice for director. I even liked his 2014 Godzilla movie more than most people, so I am far from a hater. The script is bad. Lots of exposition, despite the fact that the plot is very simplistic. Some of the characters are annoying. Everything is very predictable, to the point that there's really not a single surprise. There's little tension or sense of danger or even mystery. The cast. Most of them seem to be here to collect a paycheck. Scarlett Johansson seems a little miscast for the character she's playing, though I'd still primarily blame the writing rather than her performance. Jonathan Bailey is a non-entity. Mahershala Ali is wasted. None of these characters are memorable. The best character is probably a tiny dinosaur they meet along the way that gets a few easy ""aww"" moments. It's cheap, but it works. The special effects. As far as I could tell, the dinosaurs are 100% CGI (or close to it). Dominion was far from good but the mix of practical and CGI effects was nice to see, and a step in the right direction. I was hoping for more of that here, especially since there are several opportunities for practical effects once they get on the island. Everything looks artificial. It's also one of those movies where despite the great location photography, some of the environments still look really fake. Anyway... the last three movies in this franchise have all been pretty bad. I don't expect something on par with the first Jurassic Park, but I think we could do a little better than this!"
Jurassic World: Rebirth,6,"Honestly, the first half felt all over the place - too much talking, too many introductions, and pacing that dragged. But once they hit the island, it got better: dinosaur action scenes were intense and visual effects impressive, especially that river chase and cliff sequence. Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Bailey were solid, with Bailey bringing unexpected charm despite some forced emotional lines. The movie leans heavily on spectacle and nostalgia, yet the human characters felt shallow and underwritten - I never truly cared about them. It's entertaining as a summer blockbuster if you just want dinosaur chaos, but it lacks depth. Still, worth the watch for the action and visuals."
Chainsaw Man - The Movie: Reze Arc,10,"great adaptation. Great music, great animation, great everything. This is truly peak. This was worth the three years, sort of. I went to japan in time to actually see this movie, i didn't even know the release date in japan but i got to watch it and it was actually one of the best anime films i've ever watched, if not the best. The pacing works well for me atleast. This was probably one of the best anime adaptations of all time for me. I like kenshi yonezu's music here, he makes fire music, both the opening themes and the ending themes are fire and i like the choreography and animation, i want more of this, i want more like this, i give this a ten out of ten but i would give it an eleven if i could."
Chainsaw Man - The Movie: Reze Arc,10,"Absolute Peak of Modern Anime Cinema. From start to finish, Chainsaw Man: Reze Arc is nothing short of a masterpiece. The animation is flawless-every frame feels like a painting brought to life, fluid and breathtaking in motion. The fight sequences are not just battles, but pure visual poetry, blending brutality and beauty in a way only this series can deliver. The background score deserves its own praise. It elevates every scene, from the quiet emotional beats to the heart-pounding action, always hitting the right note. The sound design pulls you right into Denji's world, and when the intensity spikes, you feel it in your chest. The screenplay and storytelling are top-tier. The pacing is tight, no moment feels wasted, and the emotional weight of Reze's character is handled with incredible care. The film balances the chaos of Chainsaw Man's world with raw, intimate human emotions, leaving you stunned by how well it captures both. Direction-wise, it's perfect. Every shot feels intentional, every transition smooth, and the symbolism hidden in subtle details shows how much thought went into crafting this arc for the big screen. Simply put: this isn't just another anime movie-it's peak storytelling, peak animation, peak everything. Chainsaw Man: Reze Arc raises the bar for anime films, and I'll be thinking about it for a long time."
Chainsaw Man - The Movie: Reze Arc,8,"Phenomenal movie, but I have some critiques. This movie is phenomenal and is a total must watch for any fan of anime/animation. I give it an 8, and not higher, due to certain decisions that I'll explore below. Plot/Pacing: I love this movie's plot so much. The buildup is absolutely masterful, and the development of Reze and Denji's relationship is done so well. I am so glad that MAPPA didn't race through the first part of the movie. I saw some people complain about the first half of the movie being too slow, and I just don't think those people understand how important buildup is to establish a connection with the characters. If you just want to watch flashy animation, then sure maybe its too slow, but if you're here to actually get invested in the world and the characters, then you'll love the first part of the movie. Characters: Most of the characters are very well adapted to what I'd expect from the manga. Aki, Denji, Power, Beam, Angel are all done perfectly in my opinion. However, I feel like something is missing from both Reze and Makima. I feel like Makima is lacking that lurking creepy vibe that she gives off in the manga, and I feel like Reze was a bit too mellow for the events of the second half of the move. I personally wanted a bit more emotional range in her vocals during the fights and the beach scene. She felt too ""light"" in scenes where I remember reading her to be much more emotional. Animation & Art: Amazing; The artstyle is a clear upgrade from season 1, and the animation is consistently jaw dropping. There were very few sequences that I thought could have been better. Comedy: CSM is a manga that really aligns with my style of humor, and I think the movie does a much better job portraying it than what we had in season 1. However, there were some moments in the movie that seemed to gloss over really funny dialogue in a non-emphasized/passive way. Still though, this movie is very funny and its much better than 90% of typical anime humor. Ending: Sadly this is the most disappointing part of the movie for me. It's my favorite scene in the entirety of part 1 of the manga, and I cant help but feel like they misdirected it. The tone of the scene is way less creepy/horrifying than it was in the manga. Makima's voice, the shots, the expressions, and the music are way too serene. I believe they made this decision to establish a sense of dissonance, but I dont think it worked. It just kind of loses the edge/impact that it could have had if they played more into the tone of horror that the manga had. Nonetheless, it is still a great ending despite this. Overall, despite a few fumbles, this movie is downright amazing. It is definitely one of the best anime movies that I've ever seen, and it has me extremely excited for season 2 (which will cover the best arcs of the entire series)."
Chainsaw Man - The Movie: Reze Arc,5,"The story was OK for people that know it not people who don't. Chainsaw Man: The Movie is an ambitious extension of one of Japan's most popular modern anime franchises, but it's also a film that proves how polarizing the anime style can be for certain audiences. Visually, the animation is where the experience starts to falter. The artwork feels inconsistent-rough and uneven, almost like a sketchbook brought to life rather than a polished theatrical release. The movements are stiff, the transitions lack smoothness, and the overall design feels more like a test reel than a finished movie. It has that ""pencil and eraser"" quality, as if it's constantly erasing and redrawing itself mid-motion, which makes it hard to settle into. For fans of anime, this raw aesthetic might feel intentional or stylistic-but for those outside the fandom, it looks unfinished and distracting. Where the movie shines is in its storytelling. The screenplay does a solid job capturing the chaos, heart, and dark humor of the Chainsaw Man universe. It's structured well and builds its world confidently, balancing supernatural action with emotional undertones. The problem isn't the story itself-it's the delivery. The exaggerated energy, the over-the-top reactions, and the ""freeze-frame"" comedic moments that anime fans adore can feel jarring to someone not used to the genre. The dubbing doesn't help much either; what sounds natural in Japanese often feels awkward and out of place when translated to English. Lines that are meant to sound poetic or emotional can come off as strange or forced because of the tonal differences between languages. The character animation choices are also questionable. The razor-sharp teeth, for example, are clearly meant to represent the monstrous edge of these characters, but visually, it's just unsettling. It's hard to connect emotionally when the designs feel so off-putting. Denji's excitement and innocence as a character are meant to contrast with his grotesque features, but the visual balance never lands. His interactions with the female lead, while cute on paper, feel tonally mismatched-their chemistry works in concept, but visually it borders on uncomfortable. That said, the filmmakers did manage to capture the essence of Chainsaw Man's brutal and unpredictable world. The fight scenes are chaotic and intense, the blood-soaked sequences feel appropriately insane, and the dark humor occasionally hits its mark. You can tell there's passion and vision behind the work-it's just not presented in a way that makes it accessible to everyone. For longtime fans, this is another wild and unapologetic chapter. For newcomers, it might feel like a sensory overload of bizarre visuals and cultural quirks that don't translate well. The core issue is that Chainsaw Man: The Movie doesn't bridge the gap between anime loyalists and casual audiences. It assumes you already know the tone, pacing, and emotional logic of the series. Without that background, the movie doesn't pull you in-it just barrels forward, leaving you watching rather than experiencing. The film deserves credit for maintaining its creative integrity, but that same commitment makes it less inviting for outsiders. In the end, it's not a bad movie-it's just not for everyone. The story structure, pacing, and emotional arcs are solid, and for fans who understand the characters and the mythology, it probably feels like a satisfying addition to the saga. But for general audiences or anyone unfamiliar with anime tropes, it's a tough sell. Between the awkward animation, strange dubbing, and exaggerated performances, the movie struggles to connect beyond its core fanbase. It's a film made by and for Chainsaw Man fans, and while it accomplishes its goal on that front, it leaves everyone else standing on the outside looking in."
Chainsaw Man - The Movie: Reze Arc,3,"Chainsaw Man Trips Over Reze: A 3/10 Experience. The Chainsaw Man: Reze arc should have been a turning point for the series, but the adaptation falls flat in almost every meaningful way. It starts off unbearably slow, with the first half dragging along at a snail's pace. Instead of building mystery around Reze or drawing the viewer deeper into her dynamic with Denji, the story meanders through empty scenes that feel padded out and pointless. By the time anything remotely interesting happens, the buildup has already killed any sense of tension. The visuals, while flashy, are a perfect example of over-animation gone wrong. MAPPA throws fluid movement at everything, even the most mundane moments, and it ends up looking more like a demo reel for animators than a carefully crafted piece of storytelling. Every gesture is exaggerated, every scene oversold, until the impact of the actual action sequences gets diluted. It's exhausting to watch, not engaging. Reze herself is a tragic character in the manga, but the anime handles her with no subtlety at all. The adaptation leans heavily on sexual tension and surface-level fan service, reducing her to just another ""seductive love interest"" instead of a layered figure. There's no emotional depth in how she's presented, just empty pandering dressed up as romance. The soundtrack only makes matters worse. Instead of heightening emotion or giving the arc its own identity, the music feels out of place or bland to the point of being forgettable. In big fights, it's generic noise that could've been ripped from a royalty-free library, and in quieter moments it completely fails to add atmosphere. It drags the experience down rather than lifting it up. Overall, this adaptation of the Reze arc is a huge disappointment. What could have been a powerful mix of action, tragedy, and intimacy ends up hollow, overproduced, and lifeless. With a boring first half, animation that tries way too hard, shallow fan service in place of genuine storytelling, and a soundtrack that actively hurts the viewing experience, it's hard to give this anything higher than a 3/10."
Sinners,8,"More music in movies, please!!! For years I've been emphasizing the importance of music in movies; how an amazing musical score can significantly elevate a movie. It shouldn't just be background dressing. It should be brought to the forefront. It should drive the story. It should be a character in itself. It should give you goosebumps in the big moments. Sinners is one of the best examples of this. Aside from the music, I could tell I was watching high-quality filmmaking within five minutes. The directing, camerawork, editing, and sound design are pristine. The entire cast does a great job, but Michael B. Jordan shines. He is a superstar. Sinners is also surprisingly funny, without taking away from the seriousness. And the horror elements are... satisfying. This movie goes hard. Advice: Certain scenes have an expanded aspect ratio that will only be shown in IMAX. If you can't go to an IMAX, any premium screen will do (Dolby Cinema, UltraScreen, EMX, etc). This movie benefits more than most from the larger screen and louder speakers. Also, I missed A LOT of the dialogue, you may want to ask for a closed caption device."
Sinners,6,"Too much hype for a just OK movie. I really thought I was going to love Sinners even before I saw the glowing reviews, but after seeing so much hype I was really excited. Unfortunately my expectations weren't even close to being met. Not a whole lot happens in this movie, to describe the plot would only take one sentence. The filming was done well and the music elevated the overall film but it just falls flat and it left me feeling unsatisfied. I expected more from this and wish it had been as entertaining as I was promised."
Sinners,6,"The real sinners are paid critics rating this sky high. It feels like The Sinners was directed by two different Cooglers-one responsible for the first half, and another for the second. If I had to rate them separately: the first half is a solid 8, the second a disappointing 4. The film starts off brilliantly. Set in the Deep South during the 1930s, it plunges us into a world of chain gangs, overt racism, and raw human struggle-all wrapped in the soul of music. The characters are distinctive and memorable, the performances are top-notch, and the world-building is rich and atmospheric. It's a western, a drama, and a musical all at once, and somehow it works. For a while. Then comes the second half. This is where things fall apart. The pivot to horror-specifically vampires-feels abrupt and half-hearted. There's barely a story holding it together, and the horror/action sequences barely last 10-15 minutes. They lack any real suspense or memorable set pieces. The execution feels rushed and undercooked, especially after such a powerful setup. The final 5-7 minutes attempt a bold anti-Klan message, and it's likely this moment of violence and symbolism that won over many critics. But for me, it was too little, too late. What's most frustrating is the wasted potential. This could've been a truly unique vampire film-rooted in history, rich in theme, driven by character and song. Instead, it leaves you wondering what could've been if the second half had lived up to the promise of the first."
Sinners,10,"My favorite film of 2025 so far. Sinners is a film I've been looking forward to watching for awhile now and was one of my most anticipated movies of the year. After finally watching it, I can say with confidence that this is my favorite movie so far to come out in 2025. When twin brother Smoke and Stack return home from Chicago to rural Mississippi for a fresh start, they decide to take what earnings they got left to open a nightclub. Unfortunately, other than some of their old hometown friends, old lovers, and a cousin, a much evil and greater force awaits for them just in time for the debut night of their new club. For starters, Michael B. Jordan gives probably the best performance of his career so far as the twins Smoke and Stack, bringing a different persona and personality to each of the characters. Hailee Steinfeld as Mary is magnificent and for the most part has some of the best character development of the film. Wunmi Mosaku as Annie is also great in this film, while also being a huge part of the heart and soul of it. Miles Caton as Sammie Moore is also a great addition to this film and plays a very important role in it. Omar Miller as Cornbread was also a great addition. Delroy Lindo as Delta Slim also gives a great supporting performance, while also having some of the best lines and moments of the movie. Finally Jack O' Connell as Remmick and the main villain of the movie was absolutely fantastic, terrifying, while also charming in a way and is probably one the best horror movie villains I've seen in recent years. Every time his character is on screen, he steals the show and more than gets the audience's attention. If there's anything negative I have to say about the film which is little to none, I would say in the first act, it took awhile for the story to get going, but once it does finally start to take off, it makes everything more than worth while. For positives, I would like to point out that music playing a huge role and technically a character itself in the film was sensational. The horror elements were also well done, as well as a couple of action scenes that were very impressive. Overall, Sinners is so far my favorite movie of 2025, with great performances all the way around, great cinematography, and a really great story with the direction of Ryan Coogler giving Jordan Peele a run for his money in the horror genre. Rating 10/10."
Sinners,6,"Sinners has some issues. This movie is trying so hard to be From Dusk Till Dawn, but it just comes up short in comparison. The first act involves Michael B. Jordan playing a set of twins as they set up for a party, it's slow and not very interesting. I get technology is getting better, but I don't like one actor playing two sides of a conversation. It's not the Nutty Professor, it never feels fluid, and it's probably why the two main characters spend most of the movie apart. Sinners struggles to get going but once the party starts you think you're in store for some cool vampire fight scenes, but you are mistaken. Instead, vampires dance an Irish Jig that caused the person I was watching the movie with to lean over and say to me ""this is the dumbest thing I've ever seen."" what it didn't have was some cool vampire fights. The action scenes are weak and for a movie that's also weak on character development and plot, you can't afford to also be lackluster with the action. This movie would probably be more fun if you went in blind and didn't know about the genre switch coming your way, but it ruins that with too much foreshadowing early on. Overall, I don't get what all the hype is about 6/10."
Tron: Ares,7,"Don't Listen to the Critics. Go see it! I don't write reviews often, but I feel like I need to on this one. After seeing the critic reviews for TRON: Ares, I thought it would be a boring (or at least empty) movie. However, I found the storyline interesting, and found myself paying attention for the duration of the film. As some might remember, TRON: Legacy was met with terrible reviews when it came out back in 2010, and audiences received it poorly as well, making it a box office flop. Now, however, I think most will agree that it's a classic. Unfortunately, I fear the same may happen with TRON: Ares. Just to be clear: I liked it a lot. The soundtrack was good, the visuals were stunning, and the acting was solid. Could it have been ""better""? Sure, but a movie of this nature could realistically only peak at about an 8/10, so being a 7/10 is really good. GO SEE IT! It's absolutely worth the ticket price to see it in 3D or IMAX."
Tron: Ares,7,"It succeeds at being a Tron movie. Greetings User! Tron is a... unique IP, to say the least. When it released in 1982 there was nothing like it. Rotoscoping, green screen, hand drawn backgrounds and CGI mixed in with live action footage? It hadn't been done, not on that level, and it released to... middling reviews. Many praised its visuals and soundtrack whilst others complained that the narrative was flawed; some said it was too complex, others claimed it was too shallow. Whatever the case, the movie has since garnered a pretty significant cult following and is considered a classic in its own right. Then... it happened again. Tron: Legacy. Visually stunning, excellent soundtrack (many consider it to be the GOAT) but again it was found lacking in its script and was met with middling reviews and has since grown exponentially in popularity, many remembering it as on par or even better than the 82' original. Jump forward another fifteen years or so and here we are, with another gorgeous neon bathed movie with an excellent soundtrack that people can't seem to be able to make their minds up on how they feel about the contents of its script. It almost seems a right of passage at this point, but I imagine Tron: Ares like its predecessors will enjoy its fare share of devotees. The movie features a whole bunch of nods to 82' and Legacy, some of these are more welcome than others and I feel like it can sometimes feel a bit caught up in the past but it's clear at least that these people respect the series and that's more than can be said for a lot of blockbuster sequels released by major corporations in recent years. As I said, the visuals and soundtrack are sublime and though I didn't really connect with any of the users and programs in Ares the way I did with Kevin, Sam, Tron, etc. Nobody was egregious enough to stop me enjoying this movie. If you enjoy Tron as a franchise there will be things for you to enjoy here. I'm giving Tron: Ares a strong 6 to a light 7/10. Hope you enjoyed reading this review, I'm hoping to do a deep dive of reviews for entire franchise (games and shows included) so if you're interested in those, check them out. End of Line."
Tron: Ares,6,"Visually stunning, but completely soulless. In anticipation of Tron: Ares, I rewatched the original Tron (it definitely shows its age, but still earns a solid 8/10 from me for the impact it had on the genre) and Tron: Legacy (still my favorite of the three). Naturally, my expectations for Ares were high. When I heard Jared Leto had been cast as one of the leads, I was disappointed-he's never really delivered for me, with his Joker performance being the low point. Surprisingly, though, he impressed this time. He was convincing, grounded, and even held his own in scenes with Jeff Bridges. What Tron: Ares ultimately lacks, however, is soul. Unlike the previous films, I couldn't connect or empathize with any of the characters. What's left is a dazzling visual experience-absolutely worth seeing in IMAX 3D-with a pulsing, energetic soundtrack. But once the credits roll and you step out of the theater, it's completely forgettable."
Tron: Ares,5,"A Forgettable Watch. Tron: Ares totally drops the ball on continuing the legacy of Tron: Legacy, ignoring what actually made the franchise special in the first place. Instead of diving deeper into the cool ideas about the digital world and humanity, the movie gets stuck in empty nostalgia and dull corporate drama. The story's flat, the characters have no real soul, and there's zero visual innovation. The plot feels shallow, the emotions don't land, and even Jared Leto's performance just adds to the overall blandness. The only thing that really stands out is the killer soundtrack by Nine Inch Nails, seriously, it's the one part that gives the movie any kind of pulse. But beyond that, it feels like a directionless project, a half-hearted rehash with nothing new to say. In the end, it's a perfect example of how a classic franchise can lose its way when it relies too much on nostalgia instead of creativity. Rather than taking risks or exploring the big questions left by Tron: Legacy, it seems to be trying to play safe and ends up being a forgettable watch."
Tron: Ares,5,"Everything bland and boring-this movie! When I was a kid, I occasionally got the privilege of watching foreign movies like the amazing ""The Seven Samurai"" from one of the greatest Director's of all time: Akira Kurosawa. Years later, he released the movie ""Dreams ""and I convinced a friend of mine who had never heard of this Director to watch this movie at the Theater. However, as the movie progressed, I was embarrassed to have convinced him to watch it, as it was sooo gloomy and boring! It got to a point where we both just wanted to bounce before the end. However, knowing Kurosawa's caliber as a Director, I convinced myself -and my friend -to hold off till the end of the movie. And man were we glad we did! For the ending made it all worthwhile as we both came out of that movie with big smiles on our faces. Now have I watched ""Dreams"" again since then? Hell-2-tha-nah. Why? 'cause the majority of it is, like I said, too depressing and slow, even though the last few minutes is like a ray of sunshine after an interminable darkness. I guess that was the entire point of it all.... Now, why did I bring this up here.... Well, since then, no matter how bad a movie is, I'll watch it to the end just to see if the Director can surprise me. It don't happen often but sometimes, you get a surprise. Unfortunately, for Tron: Ares , I finally broke that rule. It was just too much! This movie is so bland and bad that after 3/4 of the way through, I had to walk out. That's how ""uninspired"" it is. It has some occasional good visuals but the the writing, the acting (from nearly everyone), the plot, it's just totally uninspired. Especially the plot as it feels pointless and in no way connects (despite the feeble attempts to in the beginning) to previous Tron movies. And even Jeff Bridges presence can't save this bomb of a movie. Don't get me wrong, none of the two previous Tron movies are masterpieces but for this one, it's like they hollowed out everything that made the previous movies good and then forgot to fill it back with substance and kept just the hollow shell. I actually had to immediately go back home and watch Tron: Legacy, right after, and this just to get the bad taste out my mouth. P. S., I used to think Jared Leto just had a bad break with most of the movies he was in and that it wasn't his fault. After this one, I'm convinced he should retire from acting. I won't say anymore other than to say if you watch this movie, it's at your own peril."
Superman,6,"Boring, Shallow, Predictable. I am a fan of superhero movies but this is definitely one of the worst I've ever seen. I had really high hopes for it but it did not deliver. I admit it is visually good with decent cinematography and coloring but the story and the dialog seem to be written for children. There is absolutely no creativity in this film. It is a stereotype of superhero stories. There is too much superhuman stuff going on. You can't feel connected to anyone here. Everyone seems to be on board with everything. You feel like being dragged into a party where you know no one. None of the characters are relatable, or even interesting for that matter. It feels like you are watching the third movie of a trilogy having watched neither of the previous two. I also believe the movie should be called ""Everyone But Superman""! Weirdly, he doesn't appear as the main character. He doesn't have a great fight scene or do the important things. He's just there getting bitten up with a very poorly executed redemption arc. Also, none of the jokes land. The movie isn't fun. None of the characters are funny, especially not the dog. It really tries to be funny but fails every time. I didn't expect this from James Gunn."
Superman,8,"In a time where the world feels more exhausted than ever, this film reminds us why Superman matters. Let's get one thing out of the way: I'm not a Superman fan. Never have been. It's hard to root for a nigh-invincible alien with the moral compass of a saint. I've always been more of a Batman guy-brooding billionaires with trauma just feel more... grounded. If it weren't for James Gunn at the helm, my excitement for yet another Superman reboot would be close to zero. As a huge fan of his work-from the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy to The Suicide Squad, Peacemaker, and Creature Commandos-I found myself intrigued. But even then, a question lingered in the back of my mind: Gunn has always excelled with underdogs, outcasts, and oddballs-could he really make the world's most squeaky-clean superhero compelling? The answer? A thunderous, emphatic YES. With Superman , James Gunn delivers the most emotionally resonant and thematically mature version of this beloved hero to date. The result is a film that dares to reimagine the Last Son of Krypton not as a god among men, but as a man who just happens to be a god. And it works. Beautifully. Thanks to a nuanced script and David Corenswet's pitch-perfect performance, Superman is-dare I say-relatable. Charming, earnest, even a little naïve, Corenswet captures the essential contradiction at the heart of the character: an alien more human than most of us. He's the best portrayal of Clark Kent since Christopher Reeve. Don't get me wrong, Cavill was good and had the look of Superman, but Corenswet has the soul-the farm-raised, kind-hearted boy who just wants to do what is good. Gunn smartly skips the well-worn origin story and throws us into the thick of it-an Earth already grappling with the existence of Superman. It's a move that keeps the pacing lean and allows the story to dig deeper into the world around him. And this world feels real. In a classic Gunn fashion, he weaves in sharp, timely commentary on media weaponization, current foreign affairs, and public trust. Superman's challenges are not just physical-they're moral, political, philosophical. And yet, the film never feels like it's lecturing. It just feels-timely, relevant, necessary. The emotional core is surprisingly affecting. Clark's dynamic with Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan, nailing the fierce, no-nonsense reporter) crackles with genuine tension and warmth. They bicker, they banter, they love. It's messy. It's real. Add to that the tender scenes with Clark's parents, and you have a superhero movie that somehow manages to be...intimate. When Superman tears up at a simple word from his stepdad, it hits harder than any CGI explosion. Tonally, it's classic Gunn-light and fun, with moments that feel ripped straight out of a Saturday morning cartoon. But it's not all laughs. The humor is dialed back, used sparingly and smartly. There's surprising darkness here too-moments of genuine menace and even shocking to say the least. As for the supporting cast, Nicholas Hoult's Lex Luthor is the best version we've seen on screen-cold, calculating, and utterly despicable. He's not a hammy businessman or a twitchy tech bro. He's evil, and chillingly rational about it. You want to punch him in the face. Repeatedly. That's a win. Rachel Brosnahan's Lois Lane is the definitive version-a relentless truth-seeker with zero time for nonsense. Nathan Fillion's Green Lantern is exactly what you'd expect from a James Gunn regular: a lovable asshole with some truly laugh-out-loud moments (creative use of his ring). Isabela Merced's Hawkgirl brings welcome edge, and Edi Gathegi's Mr. Terrific nearly steals the show with one of the most memorable fight sequences in the film. It's not a perfect film, though. For all its triumphs, I found myself wanting more-particularly of the Clark and Lois interactions. The film's strongest moments are its quietest ones, and at times, those are sacrificed for screen time spent on less compelling side characters. The pacing is tight, but I would've gladly traded a few action beats for more of those humanizing character moments that made this version of Superman so special. That said, the inclusion of Krypto the Superdog is a delight. Watching a nearly all-powerful being struggle to handle a naughty superdog? Every pet owner can relate. Still, by the time the credits rolled, I knew one thing: Superman is everything I wanted it to be-and then some. If this film is any indication of the direction James Gunn's DCU is heading, then DC is in very good hands. For the first time, I can honestly say that I want more of DC. In a time where the world feels more divided, more cynical, and more exhausted than ever, this film reminds us why Superman matters. He's not just about flying fast, lifting buildings, or stopping Kaijus. He's about compassion. About kindness. About doing the right thing not for glory, but because it's the right thing to do. We need that now. We need him now. He made me believe once again that there is hope."
Superman,8,"A Bold Fresh Start. James Gunn's Superman (2025) marks a bold, fresh start for the DC Universe - a film that balances humor, heavy-hitting action, and heart without ever pretending to replicate what came before. While fans of Zack Snyder's Man of Steel may not find the same brooding emotional weight, Gunn offers something different: a more hopeful, grounded, and charming Superman for a new era. This Superman isn't Henry Cavill's - and he's not trying to be. The tone is noticeably brighter, with a lightness in spirit and storytelling that reflects Gunn's signature style. The visual effects are stunning, especially during the film's action sequences, which are executed with polish and precision. What sets Superman (2025) apart, however, is its strong ensemble cast and a script that doesn't shy away from humanity, even in the face of intergalactic stakes. Cameos are peppered throughout - playful, unexpected, and satisfying for longtime fans of the DC universe. But while the film delivers thrills and laughs, it may fall short in forging a deep emotional connection with viewers. This Superman's journey, though noble and well-acted, doesn't tug at the heartstrings in the way Man of Steel once did for many. Still, Superman (2025) succeeds in its mission. It hints at the shape of Gunn's DCU to come - one built on character, grounded world-building, and a careful blend of epic and intimate. The performances are uniformly strong, giving weight to a storyline that never loses sight of its moral compass. Final Notes Before You Watch: Avoid comparing this Superman to Henry Cavill's. These are two entirely different takes, each valid in its own universe. Be punctual. The opening scene is crucial - miss it, and the film's rhythm and emotional stakes might not land as effectively. In all, Superman (2025) is an enjoyable, rewatchable experience - an optimistic leap forward for DC that promises a universe of possibility."
Superman,6,"I really want to like it.... Honestly, this version of Superman feels way too childish and overly comical. The tone is all over the place - cringey one-liners, awkward slapstick, and visuals that look like they belong in a Saturday morning cartoon. Instead of being a bold reimagining, it feels like a step back into campy territory no one really asked for. David Corenswet, while a decent lookalike, completely fails to capture the commanding presence and charisma that Henry Cavill brought to the role. Cavill had gravitas - a balance of strength, vulnerability, and quiet intensity. Corenswet feels... light. Like he's playing dress-up rather than embodying Earth's greatest protector. Worse, the theater itself reflected the film's flat tone. The room was dead quiet - barely a chuckle, almost no reaction. It was a sharp contrast to the electric energy I felt during Deadpool vs Wolverine, where the whole crowd was engaged, laughing, reacting. This Superman? It just didn't land. Compared to Man of Steel, which had emotional depth, stunning visuals, and a powerful score, this version feels hollow. It might please kids or hardcore nostalgia fans, but it's missing soul. Rating: 6/10 - Looks like Superman, but lacks the heart, presence, and impact. For something truly heroic, revisit Man of Steel."
Superman,8,"Superman is BACK like never before! This isn't just a reboot-it's a full-on resurrection of everything we love about Superman! James Gunn nails the tone: emotional, bold, and full of hope. David Corenswet owns the cape-he's charming, powerful, and finally gives us a Superman we can believe in. Rachel Brosnahan kills it as Lois Lane with wit and fire. The action is epic, the visuals are stunning, and the story hits the heart. Sure, the CGI finale gets a bit wild, but who cares? This movie flies high and brings the DC Universe back to life. A must-watch for any superhero fan! Can't wait to see where this universe goes next-this is just the beginning."
Predator: Badlands,8,"Film does good of what it tries. Predator: Badlands opens a rare window into the inner world and culture of the Yautja. It succeeds at nearly everything it attempts: introducing fresh monsters, exploring Weyland-Yutani robotics, and expanding the universe in interesting ways. That said, the film leans a bit too heavily into emotional themes such as trauma, family bonds, and even the feelings of synthetic beings. While these elements add depth, they sometimes feel redundant. Still, the movie is undeniably fun. Just don't expect it to recreate the raw atmosphere of the original Predator 1987, that lightning-in-a-bottle moment is gone forever, same thing can be said for Terminator franchise."
Predator: Badlands,9,"A New Apex: Predator: Badlands Redefines the Hunt. Dan Trachtenberg cements himself as the top action-sci-fi director right now! Badlands elevates the Predator franchise to a whole new level with jaw-dropping visuals, a brutal desert-planet setting, and narrative twists that keep you guessing every step of the way. Elle Fanning as the lead? GENIUS casting! Her character is complex, fierce, and deeply relatable-rarely do we see a female lead this powerful in a Predator film. The action sequences are insane: from ambushes in raging sandstorms to a heart-pounding one-on-one duel. The Yautja CGI is more detailed than ever, with fluid, lifelike movements that make it feel like a real apex predator. The sound design is masterful-especially when the cloak activates, it gives you chills! The score is minimalist yet highly effective, never overpowering the dialogue. For longtime fans: there are nostalgic easter eggs that feel organic, not forced. For newcomers: the story is self-contained and easy to follow. Badlands isn't just a sequel-it's an evolution. Must-watch in IMAX!"
Predator: Badlands,4,"Really disappointed. I tried to keep an open mind coming into the cinema bur knew within 20 minutes this was going to be hard to sit through. I can appreciate the director trying to expand the lore and Predator Universe but everything Stan Winston created has been watered down so 12 year olds can watch it. What was once ominous, scary and flat out brutal has been replaced by heavy amounts of cgi, a story straight out of the Mandalorian that is completely tone deaf in terms of what this character used to be. Family and kids will love it but for audiences that loved what the Predator used to be, stick with rewatching the originals because you are going to be very disappointed. Unfortunately yet again we are seeing the death of such a once great character so studious can make money from mass audiences."
Predator: Badlands,9,"The Weirdest, Coolest Predator Yet. This one honestly felt like someone threw Ice Age, Star Trek, Avatar, and Godzilla vs. Kong in a blender and it somehow works... extremely well. It's not the usual ""Predator hunts humans in the jungle"" setup. Instead, you get this frozen wasteland where a bunch of total misfits have to team up just to stay alive. It's got that Ice Age vibe .. people (and creatures) who have no business working together slowly becoming a weird little family. The Predators here aren't just mindless killers either, they've got this Klingon-style honor thing going on. You almost start to respect them, which is wild considering they're eight-foot alien murder machines. Visually, it's gorgeous. Glowing skies, alien ice storms, and massive beasts that feel ripped straight out of Avatar. And when those giant monsters finally collide with the Predators, it goes full Godzilla/King Kong chaos. It's messy in a very intriguing way: part survival adventure, part alien mythology, part monster brawl. Not perfect, but definitely the most different and interesting Predator movie ive seen."
Predator: Badlands,5,"A Unique Concept, Which Is The Only Thing Uniqe About This Film.I watched the movie on premiere day without having seen the trailers and only being semi-familiar with the franchise. And yet, even without having any expectations going into this film, it failed to captivate me in any meaningful way, resulting in just a generic popcorn flick. The story revolves around Dek, an inexperienced Predator trying to prove his worth by hunting down a dangerous creature on a planet full of living death traps. However, his quest for blood takes a turn when he meets a synthetic android named Thia. As he starts forming a connection with her, Dek begins to realize there might be more to him than just being a deadly hunter. The idea to have the main character be a lesser version of the Predator we all know and love is genius. Not only because having an alien protagonist is a rare thing to see in movies, but it would also allow the writers to explore more of the creature's mythos and give the audience a chance to see this popular figure slowly evolve into the brutal and intelligent brute he is. While we do get some lore of how the species operates, a well-paced evolution of Dek's set of skills is almost entirely absent from the movie, as he doesn't really LEARN to be better at combat or survival. Instead, he just randomly acquires the skillset to be more powerful. The movie overall feels like a mix of elements taken from other films, which were way more succesful in their execution. For example the alien world is reminiscent of the enviroment from Avatar. Altough the landscapes are visually stunning and the alien wildlife can be very creative. It also seems to me like the movie is trying to use the Guardians of the Galaxy formula of 'misfits learning about caring for each other', but doesn't really provide a fresh take on it. It tries to imitate the Disney style of forced humor and having to have a talkative, quirky character, in the form of Thia, and a cute side character to be the protagonist's 'pet'. All of which we have already seen plenty of. The villain is also incredibly paper thin and cliché, like so many other plot points in this film. All of these factors together form a movie experience that feels all too familiar and predictable to have any impact on you, despite the cool and interesting visuals. It's not something that you will completely regret spending your time watching, but you won't be able to recall what happened in this movie just a few hours after leaving the theaters..."
The Naked Gun,6,"Funny Here and There, Forgettable Overall. The old Naked Gun films thrived on Leslie Nielsen's charisma: his deadpan delivery could make even the weakest moment funny. That's why the news that Liam Neeson would star in the 2025 revival initially felt odd - he's not a comedy actor at all. But then again, Nielsen himself came from serious dramas, and the contrast is what made him iconic. In this film, Neeson does his best as the ""serious man in an absurd world,"" and sometimes it works, though the magic isn't quite there. Some jokes land, others fall completely flat. It was nice to see a respectful nod to Leslie Nielsen - a small touch that adds some warmth. Still, the movie feels mostly like a play on nostalgia: it's watchable once, with a few laughs along the way, but there's no real sense that it ever needed to exist."
The Naked Gun,7,"Understanding the source material. Very rarely do you see a remake/reboot succeed in film. They may make a lot of money but they almost always fail to capture the same energy and passion as the originals. Most reboots are made for the express purpose of making you the audience remember the fun times of the original and purely serve to be nostalgia bait. This movie is not that. It's pretty damn impressive the way the creators of this movie managed to capture the energy and tone of the original naked gun films to a tee. Without nostalgia baiting (while there are some fun callbacks) this movie stands on its own. To be a funny spoof movie in the classic vain of the Zuckers, one thing is the most important: Clever writing. You can't do a spoof movie like this without having constant bits and clever puns. These guys delivered. They came ready with tons of clever gaffs, sight gags, and quick puns that keep the audience waiting for the next joke. Couldn't nail the energy of a Zucker comedy better. Casting was perfect. Pamela Anderson was a standout for sure. Liam Neeson was also the perfect person to play Frank Drebin Jr. Overall incredibly funny movie that simultaneously pays homage to the original while also providing its own worth in comedy. Stellar job from this whole team. If you're a fan of the original Naked Gun movies you will thoroughly enjoy this."
The Naked Gun,4,"A nostalgic attempt, but missing the magic of the original. As a lifelong fan of Leslie Nielsen and his unforgettable comedy classics, I was excited but also a bit cautious, when I heard about the new Naked Gun. Sadly, after watching it, I walked away with mixed feelings. Sure, the new film has a few chuckle-worthy scenes scattered throughout. There are moments that try to capture the spirit of the original, some visual gags, a few quirky lines, and the familiar chaotic absurdity. But it just doesn't hit the mark. The original Naked Gun had something truly special: every single scene was packed with clever jokes, whether in the dialogue or hidden in the background. You could rewatch it multiple times and still catch new, subtle gags. That layered humor, the timing, the delivery, the straight-faced absurdity is what made it a classic. In this new version, it often feels like the filmmakers are trying too hard or relying too much on nostalgia, without fully understanding what made the original work. The pacing is slower, the humor is more forced, and at times it slips into just being silly rather than smartly absurd. It's not a bad film, but as someone who grew up laughing at every frame of the original, I can't help but feel this reboot lacks the sharpness, charm, and fearless stupidity that made Naked Gun legendary. Still I appreciate the effort. Reboots are never easy, especially of such iconic material. But if you're going to do Naked Gun, you have to go all-in and this one just plays it too safe."
The Naked Gun,9,"Good luck. We are all counting on you. Shame on all of us for presiding over the death of the studio comedy. Comedy movies, as of late, have existed only on streaming platforms. Not only that, but you could probably count on one hand how many ""streaming comedies"" were hits. Call it a lack of effort or call it greed, but it's been a decade since a studio comedy like this has come to a movie theater. The Naked Gun 2025 is the very thing that was missing all along. We need funny movies. We need to laugh more. Laughter is a salvation. This film has lots of laughs. Though it is a Seth MacFarlane/Lonely Island collaboration, you wouldn't know it was one without prior knowledge. This is a Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker comedy to a fault. I really felt like I was watching one of their films. The non-stop puns and sight gags fly as ferociously as they did in the original trilogy. Liam Neeson is the absolute perfect successor to Leslie Nielsen's Frank Drebin. Pamela Anderson is spectacularly funny. Everything works. Really, hats off to everyone involved for taking the risk of bringing back this franchise for a generation that, largely, didn't grow up with these films."
The Naked Gun,1,"Terribly disappointed. I rarely write movie reviews, but I feel compelled to share my disappointment with this film. I was eager for a solid slapstick comedy, a genre that's been scarce for the past two decades. Unfortunately, this movie fell far short of expectations. Despite the surprising number of positive reviews-some of which seem suspiciously incentivized or automated-the film's attempts at humor were undermined by Liam Neeson's lackluster comedic timing and a bizarre choice of thriller-style music that clashed with the intended tone. The sparse laughter in the theater reflected the film's failure to deliver. About 15 minutes in, I found myself counting down the minutes until it was over. Had I not been with a friend, I likely would have left early."
F1: The Movie,9,"F1: The Movie - A Review That Overshot the Pit Stop (But in Style). Firstly, the music. Oh boy! I came expecting engine roars... and instead got Hans Zimmer blasting emotions at 300 km/h. I wasn't prepared for this concert. I came to the theatre for Formula 1, not to feel my feelings in Dolby Atmos. The guitars and drums were doing more laps than the cars. Cinematography? A thing to Marvel at! No, no - NOT that Marvel. This isn't a multiverse; this is motorsport. But I'll give it to Kosinski - the man knows how to shoot speed. The close-ups, the helmet cams, the pit lane drama - it's all smoother than Lewis on a soft compound. Kosinski pulls it off again As expected, the Top Gun: Maverick director brings his signature hyper-real-but-just-believable-enough style. Everything looks slick, the tension is palpable, and the racing feels intense. The cars look real, the tracks feel familiar, and the drama is soaked in cinematic polish - and maybe a bit of Red Bull too. Now, dear hardcore F1 fans... You will suffer. In silence. Yes, yes - the pit stop timings are a joke, strategy makes no sense, tyre degradation is apparently fictional, and someone said ""DRS"" like it's a Marvel superpower. You'll sit there, physically cringing, as your non-F1 friends lean over and say, ""Omg I didn't know Formula 1 was this emotional."" You'll want to scream, but you won't. You'll smile. You'll nod. Then later, you'll go straight to Reddit, type furiously, and find solace in a thread titled ""Things that made no damn sense in the F1 movie - Spoiler heavy"". Final thoughts: Is it accurate? Not really. Is it entertaining? Absolutely. Is Brad Pitt believable as an ageing F1 comeback driver? Well... let's just say Fernando Alonso might have notes. Go watch it. Just don't forget - it's not Formula 1. It's Formula Fun-damentally unrealistic, but kinda awesome."
F1: The Movie,6,"Great cinematography, horrible story. Visually en auditory the race sequences are absolutely stunning, but the story, the plot and dialogue in general are just horrible and generic. It makes F1 look like an absolute joke, like just anyone can drive these cars. This supposedly 60 y/o guy can still beat these young athletes who have trained their whole lives for this sport. It just deminishes their accomplishments and hard work. Also, he can just break every rule when it comes to racing and get away with it. It makes F1 look like a clown show. Weird that f1 approved this. The only thing I liked were the racing and some funny F1 references. Although, the racing strategies were just utterly bizarre, it was still a decent watch. Disgraceful to the sport, wouldn't recommend if you're not into motorsport."
F1: The Movie,5,"Bad Writing with Great Production Work. As an F1 fan, I watched this movie when it first came out and I had no expectation whatsoever. When the movie finished, I had one thing in my mind. The movie doesn't make any sense. This movie feels like a 13-year-old boy imagination when he was bored in class. F1 is a sport and it has tons of rules in it. But this movie bend every single rules and regulations in the sport. It was very hard to watch. It was as if FIA (a motorsport association) doesn't exist anymore! The funny thing is the FIA do exist in this movie and they're so dumb that makes me wonder, who writes this movie? Don't they have consultants or experts during the development? They do. They have an F1 driver as one of the producers of this movie. A driver! Yet, the writing still turns out to be a mess! At one point, even someone that don't watch F1 is going to think, how do they allow this in a sport? In terms of writing, this movie is disappointing. This movie is not a great representation of the sport. Contradict to the writing, the production in this movie are amazing. I do have to admit that. The tension that you will feel in this movie are just chef's kiss. The music, the camera work, the whole post-production was done beautifully. It was great. It's the kind of movie where when you're in the cinema has you on the edge on your seat and so hyped, but the moment you step out, you stop and think to yourself, what the hell was that? Because this is the exact thing that happened to me. I was actually so hyped during the movie and when I stepped out, I started thinking about the plot, the crazy, and stupid things that the main character does. My mood suddenly when sour, because there is no way that the things that they had just done was allowed in the sport. It's a shame that they got these great production work to a letdown. Overall, if you like movies with adrenaline rush and no thoughts whatsoever along the movie, you will love this movie. If you like a movie with critical thinking, yikes, this movie will let you down.

F1: The Movie,6,"F1 captures the races in a unique way, but isn't fast enough to deliver a truly unique story. F1: The Movie is a new sports film directed, co-written, and produced by Joseph Kosinski, known for Tron: Legacy and Top Gun: Maverick. Promising Formula 1 driver Sonny Hayes (Brad Pitt) ended his career in the 1990s after a serious accident. Still, he continued to race as a hired driver. When team boss Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem) is in search of a new driver for his Formula 1 team, he turns to Sonny for help. Sonny agrees, but insists on racing in his own way. He is paired with Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris), the young talent on the team, and their styles and experiences clash. Still, the two must find a way to work together to give their team a shot at victory. Following his success with Top Gun: Maverick, in which Joseph Kosinski made audiences feel as if they were right there in the cockpit with Tom Cruise, he tries to achieve the same with F1. And indeed: the racing scenes are impressively shot, at times making you feel like you're actually inside Brad Pitt's race car. Visually, the film certainly impresses. However, F1: The Movie is less innovative when it comes to its story. The plot of an older, headstrong driver having to inspire or challenge the younger generation has already been seen in films like Le Mans '66 (Ford v Ferrari) and Rush. F1 seems to combine elements from these predecessors, but as a result, doesn't create a truly original or distinctive narrative. Despite the high pace of the races, the film includes several slow moments. Or the opposite: the transitions between races can be so abrupt that it becomes hard to follow. The plot remains fairly predictable, often making it easy to sense where things are headed. As with Top Gun: Maverick, many cast members performed their own stunts. Brad Pitt and Damson Idris drove the actual race cars themselves, with stunt drivers only used for dangerous scenes-though this is hardly noticeable on screen. Still, F1 doesn't quite replicate the same realistic feeling as Top Gun: Maverick, where Tom Cruise did all his stunts himself. His familiar face and physical presence were always visible, which contributed to the immersion. That sense of presence is less consistently achieved in F1."
F1: The Movie,6,"Dull storyline. Despite high expectations, F1 ultimately falls flat. The film is overly long and weighed down by a surprisingly dull storyline that never quite finds its rhythm. While Brad Pitt brings his usual charisma to the screen, even his presence isn't enough to inject energy into a script that feels more like an extended technical briefing than a gripping sports drama. The movie is packed with meticulous racing details-gear ratios, tire compounds, telemetry-but lacks emotional depth or compelling character arcs. At times, it feels more like a documentary than a narrative film. In contrast, Gran Turismo managed to explore a similar world of motorsport with a far more engaging plot and stronger storytelling. That film struck a better balance between adrenaline and heart, making F1 feel especially flat by comparison. Ultimately, unless you're a hardcore Formula 1 fan hungry for realism at the expense of drama, F1 may test your patience more than your pulse."
Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning,6,"In the pursuit of great, we failed to do good. I really wanted to like this movie, and it hurts to say that it is actually very mid. It tries to be extremely high-stakes but forgets what made the best mission films so great-not only the action but also the characters. It's hard not to see that the plot is there just to fill the time between the key stunts. But I'd like to go into more detail. The whole ""CHOICE"" situation is stupid. It's never once foreshadowed in any of the first six movies, so it feels like a retcon. Why was this even needed? It brings nothing to the story apart from Grace joining the team, which could've been done in a dozen other ways. This movie has some of the heaviest exposition I've ever seen. It felt dragged a lot of times. Not Andor-slow, rather just dragged and pointless. Characters explain things all the time, repeating and finishing each other's sentences. And even with so much info being said, it still sometimes gets unclear who the villain is or what motivation/goals they have. We learn NOTHING about the Gabriel-Ethan relationship, which was teased so much in Part 1. Honestly, in the end, if Entity chose any other guy and not the one who happens to be Ethan's old enemy, nothing would've changed. Like absolutely nothing. What was the point of those flashbacks in Part 1? We have no idea what the situation was, who that woman was, why Gabriel killed her, or why Ethan was framed for it. It brings nothing new to Ethan's character. Also, Gabriel himself is boring. We know nothing about him, and if in theory, this could've been intimidating, in practice, it just makes him a poorly written villain. Why establish a detailed background and motivation for a character if we can just throw in the same flashback here and there and make Ethan panic when he sees him the first time in DR :) (I am not saying this franchise always had nuanced villains. It's an action blockbuster of all things. But Gabriel is just rock bottom.) Final fight with Gabriel didn't feel earned or satisfying, because Gabriel is probably one of the most passive villains I've ever seen. He makes some bald statements and runs away the whole movie. And when he finally gets defeated, the scene itself is straight out of the comedy genre, in a film that otherwise tries to be obnoxiously serious. Villains in this movie generally take minimal conscious action, so they do not feel intimidating or engaging. This is especially true of AI. It is hard to be afraid of it. AI enemy sounds cool on paper, but it doesn't really fit in Mission's formula. My concerns from watching DR were proven true. In the end, all we got was a race for an ultra-tech macguffin, which has to connect to other macguffin, which can be found by using another macguffin, only then to use the final macguffin at the right timing to defeat the Entity. Sounds stupid and boring? It is. That is the price for having the enemy you can't see in the media, where everything is based on seeing. Yes, some villains from other iterations might not have been top-level, but at least the characters around Ethan made the movie engaging. This brings us to secondary characters in this movie. Paris... Pom Klementieff did a great job, but she did not have a lot to work with, unfortunately. We do not learn anything new about her. I really wanted to see her character developed in this movie, but it's just a sad mess, honestly. Same goes for Degas. He showed signs of conscience, joined Ethan to save the world, and then completely disappeared from the plot. There is just too many side characters, especially in the government and military. Most of them don't even have names. They are just plot vessels, not actual people. Lite spoiler: In the film's first minutes, you get a montage of key moments from previous entries. That looked peak in the trailer, but watching it again in the actual movie felt very cheesy. I felt like watching a fan edit on TikTok, not a Hollywood blockbuster. That ending... Probably the worst Mission ending ever. Extremely cliche and lacks emotion. I can't believe this is all they came up with, especially considering this is supposed to be the ending of a 30-year-long journey. Probably the weakest soundtrack we got since MI3. Not a musician, so I won't be commenting on this, but subjectively it is definitely not as consistent and emotional as previous ones. For me, this movie can be best described by my favourite quote from Arcane. In pursuit of the highest stakes possible, more characters than ever, and the longest, most extreme stunts, they failed to deliver the characters that make the audience care, stunts that feel natural inside the plot, and a villain who is actually intimidating."
Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning,8,"Awesome Conclusion to M:I, but tiny bit short of Dead Reckoning. Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is bombastic to put it mildly, given all the fast-paced exposition and visually resounding action setpieces. While after the Hitchcockian narrative of Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning, this concluding chapter somewhat may feel a bit inadequate - especially with all those lots of scenes in caves and lairs and prisons with no astoundingly risky turn - the highs are even higher than the lows seem lower. Let me tell you, everyone will be googling ""Mission Impossible 8 submarine scene"" a week for now. The underwater chapter is indeed breathtaking and quite original piece of filmmaking and a nice addition to M:I franchise which saves the movie big time. That 20-minute sequence with submarine is perhaps the most original piece of action written for action-oriented narratives since 1996's Mission: Impossible's own aqua cafe sequence between Ethan and Kittdridge, directed brilliantly by Brian De Palma. The suspense as Ethan so assiduously tackled all those aquatic, James Cameron-isque challanges was palpable. The realism and authenticity added the rest. Else, they have recycled tropes all over the place in order to pay homage - the gala which is rendered into a jail before the gathering itself is even exhibited - no fancy cars, garish costumes, stupendous decorum, dances, masks, bluetooth talk, etc. In here. I missed the trains as well. And narratively, there also exists this thing called predictability, and it's here to stay in the movie - the biggest weakness of The Final Reckoning. The movie is, perhaps, the least memorable for its twists - or the lack thereof - when compared to all the other M:I movies in the franchise, probably tied with Mission: Impossible 2. But that's not to say it is bad, or average or even above average - no! It's hella great!! In terms of action-based storytelling as well, this may seem like a step backwards from Mission: Impossible - Fallout. Most scenes, when considering the movie is nearly 3 hours long, is quite limited or superfluous otherwise. But all of that pays off in the final act, trust Mr. Cruise. Because that brings us to the biplane chase sequence. After 150 minutes of absolutely no motorcycles and cars chasing each other, though plenty of Cruise sprinting, the red and yellow old-school biplanes going after each other in South African skies is something that should adequately feed all the ravenous audiences. It's suspenseful, it's engaging, it's REALLY dangerous; though the villainous Gabriel character is still bland and bad, like the previous entry. The diversity, without throwing into our faces what their genders are, is probably the quintessential example of how these things should be done. Hannah Waddingham in charge of aircraft carrier was something that really paid off. I didn't like the ""lady boy"" person wearing that vest and donning horrible hairstyle in that submarine. Angela Bassett seemed a natural as a president and didn't feel forced to assume a masculine aura just because she's a female US President. Thanks to all the brilliant women in the movie to forsake that awful cliché line ""you don't think a woman can do it"" - you show them subtly rather than preaching non-stop about such superfluous substance like in some Marvel movie. Overall, a decent enough Mission: Impossible movie but a brilliant actioner, nonetheless, given how the series has always fared when compared by Hollywood's standards. Kudos to Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie."
Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning,9,"Epic conclusion! what's wrong with the critics? Okay, so last night I read some initial reviews of the movie in my feed and all of them were calling it a dull movie, one of them even calling it worse of the franchise. So, today when I entered the cinema my expectations were not so high. But throughout the movie I kept wondering when will the dull part begin! Instead, I got epic visuals, heartwarming human emotions, satisfying throwbacks for a long term MI fan. When the credit rolled I had nothing but respect for the makers, for the entire team, not just of this movie but for every movie since MI 1996. Overall, it might not top Mission Impossible Fallout but it will stay equally memorable to me. It did its job well which is to conclude the franchise in a spectacular way, without going over the top with action (think of Fast and Furious franchise). I surely liked it better than Dead Reckoning because there were more of likeable characters rather than annoying characters. It was like a bunch of good people coming together to fight a noble cause, something that was missing in the previous movie. Some people might find some of the scenes being too lengthy but I didn't mind all of the hard work being played a little longer than required. Watching Tom Cruise giving it his all was once again as thrilling as it was 25 (or so) years ago. As the movie said: our lives are the sum of our choices. Watching this movie was one of the best choice I ever made. So, if you are an MI fan don't miss this in cinema. It's going to be memorable, it's going to be epic!"
Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning,9,"A globe-trotting and pulse-pounding triumph. The Final Reckoning has its limitations and odd dramatic fixations, but it holds together as a massive cinematic experience filled with exhilarating, nail-biting, armrest-grabbing tension. Cementing its place as one of cinema's most consistent franchises, the film's breathtaking scale and death-defying stunts make for a blockbuster masterclass. Continuing Cruise and McQuarrie's intrepid crusade against the rising use of AI, it's hard not to enjoy the duo at home in their element, delivering yet more jaw-dropping stunts and globe-trotting adventure, overflowing with overly complex plot and escalating complication upon complication. In many ways, this is less an action film and more a disaster flick. Where worst-case scenarios were once implied, they are now visualised with apocalyptic projections. Gargantuan in action, runtime, and scope, The Final Recokoning completely embraces its grandiose nonsense. It acknowledges itself as huge, fun, silly, and emotionally rewarding, never attempting to restrain its exuberance, and we love it for that. A sentimental sendoff that accomplishes its mission with a characteristic flair for the impossible. Ethan can rest easy now. Mission accomplished Tom."
Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning,10,"Mission Accomplished: A Legendary Send-Off in The Final Reckoning. This is easily one of the most anticipated films of the year-and for good reason. After nearly 30 years of explosive action, daring stunts, and intricate spy plots, Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning may just be the final chapter in Ethan Hunt's legendary journey. And if it truly is the end, then what a powerful and heartfelt send-off it is. While it might not have the jaw-dropping, death-defying moment like the motorcycle jump off a cliff from Dead Reckoning Part 1-performed by Tom Cruise himself-The Final Reckoning delivers in other, equally meaningful ways. The story is packed with callbacks to previous Mission: Impossible films, cleverly weaving together a narrative that pays tribute to its roots. The return of William Donloe and flashes of Ethan from the early days (when Cruise was just 33) to now, at nearly 63, serve as a powerful reflection of time, dedication, and transformation. Amazingly, Tom Cruise still moves with the energy and intensity of someone half his age. His iconic sprint scenes are as thrilling as ever, and his commitment to physical performance continues to impress. Sure, the plot-like most spy thrillers-requires some suspension of disbelief. The odds are often impossibly small. But honestly? I didn't care. I was thoroughly entertained. Beyond the action, what stood out was the emotional depth. We see just how much Ethan cares for his team. The bond they share feels more like a family than a crew. The loss of Ilsa is heartbreaking, but it's handled with grace, and it adds real emotional weight. There are also moments of intelligent humor that bring lightness to the tension, making the 2-hour 49-minute runtime feel surprisingly brisk. The franchise began by staying close to its TV roots, where every member of the team had a special skill and no one outshined the others. At times, that format felt a little flat. But as the films evolved, so did the characters-and the emotional stakes. The introduction of Ethan's wife in Fallout added a new layer of humanity, and in this film, the emergence of new faces makes you wonder if a new team could one day carry on the legacy-even without Ethan. All in all, Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is a phenomenal conclusion to one of the greatest action franchises of all time. It's thrilling, emotional, and packed with everything fans have come to love. If this really is the end, then they've ended it in the best possible way."
